# Ore-sorter
A small silly program for my GTNH run.
Usage not advised (yet)

## 1.0 Ideas
- Move from name-only sorting
- Stop the usage of colors, implicilty name processing steps instead
- Show only unique items in scanned items list
- Show channel where previously scanned items are assigned to
- Add a subprogram to check what channel the item is assigned to
- Add a subprogram to check how full buffers are
- Add a subprogram to refresh filters from disk
- Automatically assign unambiguous items (e.g. impure piles can go only to centrifuges)
- Fix "No item in the input buffer"
- Add ability to input items by typing a name
- Add a separate line for intermediate products
- Add support for sorted and unsorted input lines
- Add support for a configurable 'overflow' chest
- ? Add option to specify amount of items to be moved, not only type (e.g. for electrolyzing)
- ? Autosampling to 'black'
- ? Implement saving/loading of filters to/from Pastebin
- ? Statistics
- ? Better options for custom routing
- ? Comments for filters to show teammates your reasoning about certain decisions
- ? Connect scanner with all the other transposers
- ? Simple GUI
